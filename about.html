    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>At ResumeAnalyzer, we are passionate technologists, designers, and career strategists driven by one core mission: to empower job seekers with the tools and insights they need to succeed in an ever-competitive job market. Founded in response to the growing complexity of online job applications and automated hiring systems, our platform leverages cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and natural language processing to bring clarity and confidence to the resume-building and job-matching process.

       With automation rapidly changing the way companies hire, resumes are no longer just read by human recruiters — they're scanned, ranked, and filtered by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). As a result, even qualified candidates often struggle to get noticed. That's where ResumeAnalyzer steps in. We provide a smart, intuitive, and user-friendly platform that evaluates your resume against specific job descriptions, helping you understand how well your profile matches and how you can improve it.

      We believe that talent should never go unnoticed just because of formatting issues or keyword mismatches. ResumeAnalyzer ensures your skills are accurately represented and effectively communicated so that your resume doesn’t just get seen — it gets shortlisted.</p>
